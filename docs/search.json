    "text": "I was born in 1973 in the city of Pelotas, in the southernmost part of Brazil. I found my way to agriculture in the lifestyle of some relatives and their friends working as scientists in agricultural sciences. My high school years, spent in a rural school, were instrumental in strengthening my connection to agriculture. Graduating with a major in agronomy in 1996 was just the beginning of my academic journey. I delved deeper into the realm of agronomy and plant pathology during my graduate studies at the Federal University of Pelotas, one of the most prominent schools of Agriculture in the country. My engagement with plant diseases solidified during my doctoral project, where I took the challenge of understanding and modeling Fusarium head blight, a disease of great significance to wheat crops.\nThe further stages of my career took me to two renowned institutions. I spent one year at Cornell University during my doctoral study and then ventured into a postdoctoral role at Iowa State University, experiences that broadened my research scope and professional network. In 2006, my career took another exciting turn when I accepted a position as assistant professor at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. For eight years, I dedicated myself to teaching, researching and mentoring students with a focus on plant disease epidemiology. Seeking new challenges, in 2014 I moved to the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) to take a prestigious position in plant disease epidemiology as associate professor. Here, now as a full professor, I found immense gratification in mentoring, educating, and guiding aspiring scientists during their master’s and doctoral journeys.\nThroughout my career, I have strongly advocated for the principles of open science. Within my lab, transparency isn’t a mere concept but an integral part of our operational ethos. We use R language for our statistical analyses and data processes, and we openly share our computational codes and findings as preprints.\nMy dedication to disseminating knowledge freely inspired me to take the route of open education, leading me to self-publish this book entitled “R for Plant Disease Epidemiology” which is written entirely using open source tools. I chose this approach to guarantee the book’s accessibility and updatability, mirroring the ever-evolving nature of both the field of plant pathology and the R programming environment.\nI dedicate this book to my wife, Isabel, and our son, Vitor, who have been my pillars of strength and support. Their love and understanding have been unwavering, especially during the times I am distant, immersed in the demanding process of writing this book."

    "text": "1.1 Defining plant disease\nDisease in plants can be defined as any malfunctioning of host cells and tissues that results from continuous irritation by a pathogenic agent or environmental factor and leads to development of symptoms (Agrios 2005a). When caused by pathogenic agent, the disease results from the combination of three elements: susceptible host plant, a virulent pathogen, and favorable environmental conditions - the famous disease triangle. When a pathogen population establishes and causes disease in a host population, the phenomenon is called an epidemic, or the disease in populations. Among several definitions of epidemic, a comprehensive one is the change in disease intensity in a host population over time and space (Madden et al. 2007).\nThere exist numerous iterations of the disease triangle, incorporating additional elements (e.g., human intervention and time) as points and/or dimensions to provide a more comprehensive representation of an epidemic (Agrios 2005b). We find the disease prism particularly illustrative, where a sequence of stacked triangles represent the evolution of a plant disease through time (Francl 2001).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The plant disease prism as a model of plant disease epidemics"

    "section": "1.2 Importance of epidemics",
    "text": "1.2 Importance of epidemics\nEpidemics bear significant economic importance due to their potential to decrease crop yields, diminish product quality, and escalate control costs, contingent on their intensity level. Numerous historical examples of widespread epidemics, reaching pandemic levels and resulting in catastrophic effects on crops, have been documented (Agrios 2005b). The Irish potato famine of 1845–1847, caused by the late blight pathogen (Phytophthora infestans), is a famous example of a well-documented pandemic. This disease notably altered the course of history in Europe and the United States, and was pivotal in the evolution of the science of plant pathology. During the 1840s, the pathogen ravaged potato crops, which were a dietary staple for the Irish. The disease outbreak was triggered by the introduction of a novel, virulent pathogen population that found suitable environmental conditions (cool and wet weather) for infection and development within a dense population of susceptible hosts.\nHowever, there are several reasons why devastating epidemics may continue to unfold. Recent history has seen severe epidemics reaching pandemic levels due to the incursion of pathogens into regions where they had previously been absent (refer to Box 1). Alternatively, new pathogenic strains might emerge as a result of factors driving genetic diversity within the local pathogen population. A case in point is the Ug99 strain of the wheat stem rust, which poses a significant threat to global wheat production. First identified in Uganda in 1998, an asexual lineage has propagated through Africa and the Middle East, causing catastrophic epidemics. Research suggests that Ug99 emerged via somatic hybridization and nuclear exchange between isolates from different lineages (Li et al. 2019). Finally, disease emergence or re-emergence can be influenced by shifts in climatic patterns. For instance, the Fusarium head blight of wheat caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum. In Southern Brazil, the increased frequency of severe epidemics resulting in greater yield loss since the early 1990s has been linked to alterations in rainfall patterns across decades (Duffeck et al. 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBox 1: Diseases on the move\n\n\n\nIn Brazil, the soybean rust pathogen (Phakopsora pachyrhizi) first reached southern Brazil in 2002 (Yorinori et al. 2005). The disease spread to all production regions of the country in the following few years, severely reducing yields. To overcome the problem, farmers have relied on massive applications of fungicides on soybeans, which dramatically increased the production costs with the need for sequential fungicide sprays to combat the disease. Total economic loss have been estimated at around US$ 2 billion yearly (Godoy et al. 2016). More recently, wheat blast, a disease that originated in the south of Brazil in 1984, and have been restricted to South America, was firstly spotted in South Asia, Bangladesh, in 2016. Blast epidemics in that occasion devastated more than 15,000 ha of wheat and reduced yield of wheat in the affected field up to 100% (Malaker et al. 2016; Islam et al. 2019). The disease was later found in Zambia, thus also becoming a threat to wheat production in Africa (Tembo et al. 2020). In Brazil, the wheat blast disease is a current threat to expansion of wheat cultivation in the tropics(Cruz and Valent 2017)."

    "section": "1.3 History of Epidemiology",
    "text": "1.3 History of Epidemiology\nBotanical epidemiology, or the study of plant disease epidemics, is a discipline with roots tracing back to the early 1960s. However, its origins can be linked to events from centuries and decades prior. For instance, in 1728, Duhamel de Monceau presented the earliest known epidemiological work on a disease, referred to as ‘Death,’ that afflicted saffron crocus (Rhizoctonia violacea). Fast forward to 1858, a textbook detailing plant diseases, written by Julius Kuhn, made its debut, introducing the concept of an epidemic as illustrated by the Irish late blight epidemics of 1845-46. Subsequently, in 1901, H.M. Ward adopted an ecological perspective to the study of plant diseases in his seminal book, Disease in Plants. By 1946, Gäumann penned the first book exclusively devoted to plant disease epidemiology.\nFurther evolution of this field was marked by the publication of a chapter titled “Analysis of Epidemics” by J.E. Vanderplank in Plant Pathology, vol. 3, edited by Horsfall and Dimond, in 1960. Vanderplank elaborated on his pioneering ideas in his 1963 book, “Plant Diseases: Epidemics and Control”(Vanderplank 1963). He is universally recognized as the foundational figure of plant disease epidemiology (Zadoks and Schein 1988; Thresh 1998), his landmark book being the first to comprehensively describe and quantify plant disease epidemics, and offering a theoretical framework for epidemic analysis.\nIn the same year, the first International Epidemiology Workshop was convened in Pau, France. This event constitutes an important milestone in the historical narrative, significantly contributing to the molding of this emergent discipline.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Group photo of the First International Epidemiology Workshop\n\n\nThe International Epidemiology Workshop (IEW) is the principal working group of plant disease epidemiology. This is an organization with a rich history whose members have met approximately every 5 years since 1963. Thus far, 13 meetings have been organized/planned:\n1963 - Pau, France\n1971 - Wageningen, The Netherlands\n1979 - Penn State, United States\n1983 - NC State, Raleigh, United States\n1986 - Jerusalem, Israel\n1990 - Giessen, Germany\n1994 - Papendal, The Netherlands\n2001 - Ouro Preto, Brazil\n2005 - Landerneau, France\n2009 - Cornell, Geneva, United States\n2013 - Beijing, China\n2018 - Lillehammer, Norway\n2024 - Iguassu Falls, Brazil"

    "text": "2.1 Disease quantification\nStudies on the temporal progression or spatial spread of epidemics cannot be conducted without field-collected data, or, in some cases, simulated data. The study of plant disease quantification, termed Phytopathometry, is a subdivision of plant pathology concerned with the science of disease measurement. It has strong ties to the field of epidemiology (Bock et al. 2021).\nTraditionally, disease quantification has been executed through visual evaluation. However, the past few decades have witnessed significant advancements in imaging and remote sensing technologies (which don’t necessitate contact with the object), leaving a profound impact on this field. As such, disease quantity can now be gauged through estimation (visually, by the human eye) or measurement (through remote sensing technologies such as RGB, MSI, and HSI) Figure 2.1.\nWhile the utilization of digital or remote sensing technology for disease measurement or estimation provides a more objective approach, visual assessment is largely subjective. It is known to vary among human raters, as these raters differ in their innate abilities, training, and how they are influenced by the chosen method (e.g., scales). Disease is estimated or measured on a specimen within a population, or on a sample of specimens drawn from that population. The specimen in question can be a plant organ, an individual plant, a group of plants, a field, or a farm. The specific specimen type also determines the terminology used to describe disease quantity.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Different approaches used to obtain estimates or measures of plant disease. RGB = red, green, blue; MSI = multispectral imaging; HSI = hyperspectral imaging.\n\n\ninally, while developing new or refining existing disease assessment methods, it is crucial to evaluate the reliability of the assessments made by different raters or instruments, as well as their accuracy—specifically, how close the estimations or measurements are to the reference (or gold standard) values. Several methods are available for assessing the reliability, precision, and accuracy of these estimates or measurements (see definitions). The choice of methods depends on the objective of the work, but largely on the type or nature of the data. These considerations will be further discussed."

    "text": "2.2 Disease variables\nA common term used to reference the quantity of disease, irrespective of how it is expressed, is ‘disease intensity’. This term, however, has minimal practical value as it only implies that the disease is more or less “intense”. We require more specific terminology to standardize the reference to disease quantity and methodology. One of the primary tasks in disease assessment is classifying each specimen, often in a sample or within a population, as diseased or not diseased. This binary (yes/no or 1/0) evaluation may sufficiently express disease intensity if the goal is to ascertain the number or proportion of diseased specimens in a sample or a population.\nThis discussion brings us to two terms: disease incidence and prevalence. Incidence is typically used to denote the proportion or number (count) of plants (or their organs) deemed as observational units at the field scale or below. On the other hand, prevalence refers to the proportion or number of fields or farms with diseased plants within a larger production area or region (Nutter et al. 2006) Figure 2.2. Therefore, prevalence is analogous to incidence, with the only difference being the spatial scale of the sampling unit.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Schematic representation of how prevalence and incidence of plant diseases are calculated depending on the spatial scale of the assessment\n\n\nIn many instances, it’s necessary to determine the degree to which a specimen is diseased, a concept defined as disease severity. In certain contexts, severity is narrowly defined as the proportion of the unit that exhibits symptoms (Nutter et al. 2006). However, a more expansive view of severity includes additional metrics such as nominal or ordinal scores, lesion count, and percent area affected (ratio scale). Ordinal scales are broken down into rank-ordered classes (see specific section), defined based on either a percentage scale or descriptions of symptoms (Bock et al. 2021). Occasionally, disease is expressed in terms of (average) lesion size or area, which could be regarded as a measure of severity. These variables represent different levels of measurements that provide varying degrees of information about the disease quantity - from low (nominal scale) to high (ratio scale) Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Scales and associated levels of measurement used to describe severity of plant diseases"

    "text": "2.3 Data types\nThe data used to express disease as incidence or any form of severity measurements can be discrete or continuous in nature.\nDiscrete variables are countable (involving integers) at a particular point in time. In other words, only a finite number of values (nominal or ordinal) is possible, and these cannot be subdivided. For instance, a plant or plant part can be either diseased or not diseased (nominal data). It’s not possible to count 1.5 diseased plants. Furthermore, a plant classified as diseased may exhibit a certain number of lesions (count data), or be categorized into a specific severity class (ordinal data, common in ordinal scales, e.g., 1-9). Disease data in the form of counts often relates to the number of infections per sampling units. Most commonly, these counts refer to the assessed pathogen population, such as the number of airborne or soilborne propagules.\nIn contrast to discrete variables, continuous variables can be measured on a scale and can assume any numeric value between two points. For example, the size of a lesion on a plant can be measured at a very precise scale (cm or mm). An estimate of severity on a percent scale (% diseased area) can take any value between non-zero and 100%. Although incidence at the individual level is discrete, at the sample level it can be treated as continuous, as it can assume any value in proportion or percentage.\nDisease variables can also be characterized by a statistical distribution, which are models that provide the probability of a specific value (or a range of values) being drawn from a particular distribution. Understanding statistical or mathematical distributions is a crucial step in improving our grasp of data collection methods, experiment design, and data analysis processes such as data summarization or hypothesis testing."

The statistical distribution that best describe the incidence data at the individual level is the binomial distribution.\nLet’s simulate the binomial outcomes for a range of probabilities in a sample of 100 units, using the rbinom() function in R. For a single trial (e.g., status of plants in a single plant row), the size argument is set to 1.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(r4pde)\n\n\nset.seed(123) # for reproducibility\nP.1 &lt;- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.1)\nP.3 &lt;- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.3)\nP.7 &lt;- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.7)\nP.9 &lt;- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.9)\nbinomial_data &lt;- data.frame(P.1, P.3, P.7, P.9)\n\nWe can then visualize the plots.\n\nbinomial_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(1:4, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"#339966\",\n                 bins = 10) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) +\n  theme_r4pde()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Binomial distribution to describe binary data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Beta distribution\nIn many studies, it’s often useful to express these quantities as a proportion of the total population or sample size, rather than absolute numbers. This helps standardize the data, making it easier to compare between different populations or different time periods.\nFor example, if we’re studying a plant disease, we could express disease incidence as the proportion of plants that are newly diseased during a given time period. Similarly, disease severity could be expressed as the proportion of each plant’s organ area that is affected by the disease. These proportions are ratio variables, as they can take on any value between 0 and 1, and ratios of these variables are meaningful.\nThe Beta distribution is a probability distribution that is defined between 0 and 1, which makes it ideal for modeling data that represents proportions. It’s a flexible distribution, as its shape can take many forms depending on the values of its two parameters, often denoted as alpha and beta.\nLet’s simulate some data using the rbeta() function.\n\nbeta1.5 &lt;- rbeta(n = 1000, shape1 = 1, shape2 = 5)\nbeta5.5 &lt;- rbeta(n = 1000, shape1 = 5, shape2 = 5)\nbeta_data &lt;- data.frame(beta1.5, beta5.5)\n\nNotice that there are two shape parameters in the beta distribution: shape1 and shape2 to be defined. This makes the distribution very flexible and with different potential shapes as we can see below.\n\nbeta_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"#339966\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 15) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P)+\n  theme_r4pde()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Binomial distribution to describe proportion data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Beta-binomial distribution\nThe Beta-Binomial distribution is a mixture of the Binomial distribution with the Beta distribution acting as a prior on the probability parameter of the binomial. Disease probabilities can vary across trials due to a number of unobserved or unmeasured factors. This variability can result in overdispersion, a phenomenon where the observed variance in the data is greater than what the binomial distribution expects.\nThis is where the Beta-Binomial distribution comes in handy. By combining the Beta distribution’s flexibility in modeling probabilities with the Binomial distribution’s discrete event modeling, it provides an extra layer of variability to account for overdispersion. The Beta-Binomial distribution treats the probability of success (disease occurrence in this context) as a random variable itself, following a Beta distribution. This means the probability can vary from trial to trial.\nTherefore, when we observe data that shows more variance than the Beta distribution can account for, or when we believe there are underlying factors causing variability in the probability of disease occurrence, the Beta-Binomial distribution is a more appropriate model. It captures both the variability in success probability as well as the occurrence of the discrete event (disease incidence).\nWhen combined with the Binomial distribution, which handles discrete events (e.g. whether an individual is diseased or not), the Beta-Binomial distribution allows us to make probabilistic predictions about these events. For example, based on prior data (the Beta distribution), we can estimate the likelihood of a particular individual being diseased (the Binomial distribution).\nIn R, the rBetaBin function of the FlexReg package generates random values from the beta-binomial distribution. The arguments of the function are n, or the number of values to generate; if length(n) &gt; 1, the length is taken to be the number required. size is he total number of trials. mu is the mean parameter. It must lie in (0, 1). theta is the overdispersion parameter. It must lie in (0, 1). phi the precision parameter. It is an alternative way to specify the theta parameter. It must be a positive real value.\n\nlibrary(FlexReg) \nbetabin3.6 &lt;- rBetaBin(n = 100, size = 40, mu = .3, theta = .6)\nbetabin7.3 &lt;- rBetaBin(n = 100, size = 40, mu = .7, theta = .3)\nbetabin_data &lt;- data.frame(betabin3.6, betabin7.3)\n\n\nbetabin_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"#339966\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 15) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) +\n  theme_r4pde()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Beta-binomial distribution to describe proportion data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Poisson distribution\nWhen conducting studies in epidemiology, specifically plant diseases, researchers often collect data on the number of diseased plants, infected plant parts, or individual symptoms, such as lesions. These variables are counted in whole numbers - 1, 2, 3, etc., making them discrete variables. Discrete variables contrast with continuous variables that can take any value within a defined range and can include fractions or decimals. In addition to being discrete, these variables are also non-negative, meaning they cannot take negative values. After all, you can’t have a negative number of diseased plants or lesions. Given these characteristics, a suitable distribution to model such data is the Poisson distribution. This distribution is particularly suitable for counting the number of times an event occurs in a given time or space.\nIn R, we can used the rpois() function to obtain 100 random observations following a Poisson distribution. For such, we need to inform the number of observation (n = 100) and lambda, the vector of means.\n\npoisson5 &lt;- rpois(100, lambda = 10)\npoisson35 &lt;- rpois(100, lambda = 35)\npoisson_data &lt;- data.frame(poisson5, poisson35)\n\n\npoisson_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"#339966\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 15) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) +\n  theme_r4pde()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Poisson distribution to describe count data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.5 Negative binomial distribution\nWhile the Poisson distribution is indeed suitable for modeling count data, it assumes that the mean and variance of the data are equal. However, in real-world scenarios, especially in epidemiology, it is common to encounter overdispersed data - where the variance is greater than the mean. This could occur, for instance, if there’s greater variability in disease incidence across different plant populations than would be expected under the Poisson assumption.\nIn such cases, the Negative Binomial distribution is a better alternative. The Negative Binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a sequence of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials before a specified (non-random) number of failures occurs.\nOne of the key features of the Negative Binomial distribution is its ability to handle overdispersion. Unlike the Poisson distribution, which has one parameter (lambda, representing the mean and variance), the Negative Binomial distribution has two parameters. One parameter is the mean, but the other (often denoted as ‘size’ or ‘shape’) governs the variance independently, allowing it to be larger than the mean if necessary. Thus, it provides greater flexibility than the Poisson distribution for modeling count data and can lead to more accurate results when overdispersion is present.\nIn R, we can use the rnbinom() function to generate random variates from a Negative Binomial distribution. This function requires the number of observations (n), the target for the number of successful trials (size), and the probability of each success (prob).\nHere’s an example:\n\n# Generate 100 random variables from a Negative Binomial distribution\nnegbin14.6 &lt;- rnbinom(n = 100, size = 14, prob = 0.6)\nnegbin50.6 &lt;- rnbinom(n = 100, size = 50, prob = 0.6)\nnegbin_data &lt;- data.frame(negbin14.6, negbin50.6)\n\n\nnegbin_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"#339966\",\n                 color = \"white\", bins = 15) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) +\n  theme_r4pde()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Negative binomial distribution to describe overdispersed count data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.6 Gamma distribution\nIn plant disease epidemiology and other fields of study, we may often encounter continuous variables - these are variables that can take on any value within a given range, including both whole numbers and fractions. An example of a continuous variable in this context is lesion size, which can theoretically be any non-negative value.\nOften, researchers use the normal (Gaussian) distribution to model such continuous variables. The normal distribution is symmetric, bell-shaped, and is fully described by its mean and standard deviation. However, a fundamental characteristic of the normal distribution is that it extends from negative infinity to positive infinity. While this is not a problem for many applications, it becomes an issue when the variable being modeled cannot take on negative values - like the size of a lesion.\nThis is where the Gamma distribution can be a good alternative. The Gamma distribution is a two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions, which does not include negative values, making it an appropriate choice for modeling variables like lesion sizes. While it might seem a bit more complicated due to its two parameters, this also allows it a greater flexibility in terms of the variety of shapes and behaviors it can describe. The Gamma distribution is often used in various scientific disciplines, including queuing models, climatology, financial services, and of course, epidemiology. Its main parameters are the shape and scale (or alternatively shape and rate), which control the shape, spread and location of the distribution.\nWe can use the rgamma() function that requires the number of samples (n = 100 in our case) and the shape, or the mean value.\n\ngamma10 &lt;- rgamma(n = 100, shape = 10, scale = 1)\ngamma35 &lt;- rgamma(n = 100, shape = 35, scale = 1)\ngamma_data &lt;- data.frame(gamma10, gamma35)\n\n\ngamma_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"#339966\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 15) +\n  ylim(0, max(gamma_data$gamma35)) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) +\n  theme_r4pde()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Gamma distribution to describe continuous data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.7 Simulating ordinal data\nOrdinal data is a statistical data type consisting of numerical scores that fall into a set of categories which are ordered in a meaningful way. This can include survey responses (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree), levels of achievement (e.g., poor, average, good, excellent), or, in the case of plant disease, disease severity scales (e.g., 0 to 5, where 0 represents a healthy plant and 5 represents a plant with severe symptoms).\nWhen working with ordinal data, we often need to make assumptions about the distribution of the data. However, unlike continuous data which might be modeled by a normal or Gamma distribution, or count data which might be modeled by a Poisson distribution, ordinal data is discrete and has a clear order but the distances between the categories are not necessarily equal or known. This makes the modeling process slightly different.\nWe can use the sample() function and define the probability associated with each rank. Let’s generate 30 units with a distinct ordinal score. In the first situation, the higher probabilities (0.5) are for scores 4 and 5 and lower (0.1) for scores 0 and 1, and in the second situation is the converse.\n\nordinal1 &lt;- sample(0:5, 30, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.5))\nordinal2 &lt;- sample(0:5, 30, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.5, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1))\nordinal_data &lt;- data.frame(ordinal1, ordinal2)\n\n\nordinal_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(1:2, names_to = \"P\",\n               values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"#339966\",\n                 color = \"white\",\n                 bins = 6) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ P) +\n  theme_r4pde()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Sampling of ordinal data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBock, C.
